    <h1>Creme Brulee</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crème Brûlée is a decadent French dessert featuring a rich, velvety vanilla
        custard base topped with a layer of hard caramelized sugar. The contrast between
        the smooth, cool custard and the crisp, torched sugar crust creates an irresistible
        textural experience. Made with just cream, egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla, this elegant
        dessert is surprisingly simple to prepare yet impressive enough for special occasions.
        After baking and chilling, the sugar topping is caramelized with a kitchen torch
        or broiler, resulting in its signature glass-like finish that cracks delightfully
        under a spoon.</p>
    <p>Perfect for dinner parties, Crème Brûlée can be made ahead and customized
        with flavors like citrus zest, espresso, or liqueurs. Its timeless sophistication
        lies in its minimal ingredients and maximal indulgence—a true classic that never
        goes out of style.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream (480ml)</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar (100g), plus extra for caramelizing</li>
        <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean (seeds scraped)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat oven</strong> to 325°F (160°C). Place 4-6 ramekins in a deep baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat cream</strong>: In a saucepan, warm 2 cups heavy cream with 1 tsp vanilla (or vanilla bean
            seeds) until steaming (do not boil). Remove from heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk yolks & sugar</strong>: In a bowl, whisk 5 egg yolks, ½ cup sugar, and a pinch of salt until
            pale and thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Temper eggs</strong>: Slowly pour the hot cream into the yolk mixture while whisking constantly to
            prevent curdling.</li>
        <li><strong>Strain & pour</strong>: Strain the custard through a fine sieve into the ramekins for ultra-smooth
            texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong>: Fill the baking dish with hot water halfway up the ramekins (bain-marie). Bake 30-35
            mins until set but slightly jiggly in the center.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill</strong>: Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight).</li>
        <li><strong>Caramelize</strong>: Sprinkle 1-2 tsp sugar evenly over each custard. Torch until golden and bubbly,
            or broil 2-3 mins.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Let the sugar harden for 1-2 minutes, then enjoy the crack!</li>
    </ol>
