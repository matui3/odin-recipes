    <h1>Hong Kong Style Egg Tart</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hong Kong-style egg tarts are a beloved pastry featuring a flaky, buttery crust filled with a silky-smooth egg
        custard. These bite-sized delights strike the perfect balance between rich and light, with a crisp, layered
        exterior that shatters delicately to reveal a jiggly, slightly sweetened center. Inspired by Portuguese
        <i>pastéis de nata</i> but refined in Cantonese bakeries, they're a staple of dim sum culture—best enjoyed fresh
        from the oven with a cup of milky tea.
    </p>

    <p>What sets them apart is their texture: the crust, made with either puff pastry or a shortcrust dough, contrasts
        beautifully with the creamy, caramelized custard. Simple ingredients like eggs, sugar, and evaporated milk
        create a fragrant, velvety filling that's barely set—like a cross between crème brûlée and flan. Whether eaten
        warm or at room temperature, these golden tarts embody Hong Kong's fusion of East-meets-West culinary charm.</p>
